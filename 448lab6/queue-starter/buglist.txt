This queue does not actually have a FIFO structure. Either its enqueue function is broken, or its peekFront returns the value of m_back instead of the values of m_front. 
When one enqueues multiple values, peekFront() returns the most recent value added as the "front", so either enqueue() works but peekFront() is incorrectly a  peekBack() method, or peekFront() works but enqueue() is actually a push() function.
Also using Valgrind, I noticed that the destructor does not work properly, because there are memory leaks.
